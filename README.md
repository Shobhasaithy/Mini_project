# Mini_project
Phishing tricks users into revealing sensitive info. This project created a Chrome extension with a Flask ML backend to detect phishing URLs in real time. It analyzes URLs, classifies them, and uses a confidence threshold to reduce false positives. A chatbot and quizzes raise user awareness.
